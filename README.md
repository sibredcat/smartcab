Reinforcemnt learning project for submission to Udacity

KEYWORDS: Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning, Optimization, Modeling, Model Tuning, Statistics, Python

Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem
in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and 
penalties.
